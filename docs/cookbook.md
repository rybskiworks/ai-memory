## What ai-memory is, in one paragraph

ai-memory gives your AI coding agents long-term, cross-session memory. It runs
as one server; your agent talks to it over MCP (tools like `memory_query`,
`memory_write_page`) and over lifecycle hooks that automatically capture what you
do. Memory is a **markdown wiki in git** (the source of truth, hand-editable) plus
a derived SQLite index for search. Everything is **scoped per project**
`(workspace, project)`, resolved from your working directory. It works with no
LLM at all (capture + full-text search + rule-based summaries); adding a provider
enables consolidation and auto-improvement.

## Everyday tasks (through your agent, over MCP)

You mostly just talk to your agent; it calls the right tool. Common ones:

| You want | Say to your agent | Tool it uses |
|---|---|---|
| Recall prior work | "Have we discussed X?" / "what did we decide about Y?" | `memory_query` |
| Catch up after time away | "Where did we leave off?" / "catch me up" | handoff block / `memory_explore` |
| Remember a durable fact | "Remember that we always use pnpm here" | `memory_write_page` |
| Remember until a date | "Remember this until the migration ships" | `memory_write_page` + `expires_at` |
| A standing rule for *every* project | "Always: never force-push" | `memory_write_page` with `scope: "global"` |
| Read a specific saved page in full | "Read the `_rules/deploy` page" | `memory_read_page` |
| Save context for the next session | "Wrap up — save context for next time" | `memory_handoff_begin` |
| See project stats | "How much memory do we have?" | `memory_status` / `memory_briefing` |

You rarely write pages by hand: lifecycle hooks capture prompts and tool calls
automatically, and (with an LLM) consolidation compiles them into pages.

## Recipe: keep a rule a project must follow

> "Remember: before touching the payment code, read the PCI notes."

Your agent calls `memory_write_page` and it lands as a durable wiki page (routed
under `_rules/` when it's a rule). Next session, `memory_query` surfaces it, and
if the project's `.ai-memory.toml` opts into the on-start brief, rules are
prepended to the agent's context automatically. To make it apply to **all** your
projects, ask for it as a global rule (`scope: "global"`).

## Recipe: have a project read a specific document before implementing

Two ways, depending on where the document lives:

1. **It's already a wiki page** (you saved it, or imported it — below): tell the
   agent "read the `norms/gdpr-retention` page before implementing" — it calls
   `memory_read_page` with that path and works from the full body.
2. **It's an external file** (a norm/spec on disk): save it as a page first
   ("remember this spec as `norms/gdpr-retention`", paste or point at it), then
   reference it as in (1). Large references are best split into a page per
   document so retrieval can pull just the relevant one.

## Recipe: import an existing knowledge base (e.g. OKF norms/laws/specs)

ai-memory's wiki **is** OKF (Obsidian-compatible markdown + frontmatter). To
bring an existing body of documents in as project memory:

- **A few documents**: save each as a durable page via your agent
  (`memory_write_page`) or the CLI (`ai-memory write-page`), one page per
  document, under a stable prefix like `norms/…`. Then any project can read a
  specific one before implementing (recipe above).
- **A whole OKF/Obsidian vault or an export from another tool**: use the
  companion importer (see [`companion-crates.md`](companion-crates.md)) — it
  ingests OMC and external-conversation exports into the store. `ai-memory
  export-okf` is the inverse (export your wiki as an OKF bundle), useful to see
  the exact on-disk shape your documents should take.
- The wiki lives at `<data_dir>/wiki/<workspace>/<project>/…` and is plain
  markdown in git, so you can also drop files in and let the file watcher +
  reindex pick them up. Keep them under a clear prefix and commit.

Once the material is saved as pages in the right scope, any project can search
it (`memory_query`) and read a specific document in full (`memory_read_page`)
before implementing against it.

## Recipe: control what gets kept, aged, or consolidated

By default nothing you have to think about: memory decays on a single gentle
curve, and an upgrade to 2.4 changes no scores and evicts nothing. When you *do*
want to tune aging, it is all opt-in and reversible — the original of anything
compacted or merged stays in git and the supersession chain, recoverable with
`ai-memory restore-page`.

- **Keep something forever:** pin it. A pinned page is exempt from the
  forget-sweep regardless of tier or age. Semantic and procedural pages never
  decay either — only working/episodic memory ages.
- **Make a note expire on a deadline:** ask your agent to remember it "until
  <date>" (an `expires_at`); the forget-sweep deletes it when the time passes,
  no matter how often it was read. A TTL outranks pinning.
- **Tune how long each tier lasts:** set per-tier half-lives in the project's
  `.ai-memory.toml` `[decay.half_life_days]` (e.g. keep episodic history longer,
  working-tier scratch shorter). Omit it for the default single curve.
- **Compact instead of evict, and de-duplicate:** `[decay] compact_cold_episodic`
  keeps a cold page's durable facts (paths, error codes, decisions) and drops the
  prose; `[decay] dedup_cold_clusters` collapses near-duplicate cold pages into
  one survivor. Both are zero-LLM, off by default, and supersede rather than
  delete.
- **Keep used memory longer:** nothing to configure — a page you open, search,
  or reach through a related-pages walk is reinforced automatically and resists
  decay.
- **Surface likely contradictions:** run `memory_lint` (through your agent or the
  CLI); with embeddings configured it flags pairs of same-topic pages that look
  like they conflict, advisory only.
- **Let an LLM consolidate on idle ("dream"):** with a provider *and* an embedder
  configured, `[dream] enabled` turns on a background pass that rewrites clusters
  of cold notes into single coherent pages while you're idle and cancels the
  moment you return. It is off by default, never deletes a source, and is gated on
  an internal recall eval before it could ever become default behavior.

## Recipe: two agents / two repos working together

- **Continuity across agents in the same project** (quit Claude Code, open Codex
  in the same repo): automatic. A handoff is captured at session end and the
  next session's on-start hook prepends it. Ask "where did we leave off?".
- **Ask an agent in another project to do something** without loading that
  project's context here: cross-project messaging — "send project-b a request to
  add the export endpoint" (`memory_message_send`), and over there "check my
  inbox" (`memory_message_pop`). See [`agent-messaging.md`](agent-messaging.md).

## Recipe: run the server on a Mac

Use the menu bar app when you want one `.app` that starts the server and
opens the existing tools (web UI, `ai-memory status`, config, logs). It does
not replace those tools with a second dashboard.

```bash
./companions/ai-memory-macos/build.sh
open "companions/ai-memory-macos/dist/AI Memory.app"
```

Drag **AI Memory.app** to `/Applications`, then **Install & Start Server**
from the menu extra. Wire an agent with the bundled binary:

```bash
BIN="/Applications/AI Memory.app/Contents/Resources/runtime/ai-memory"
"$BIN" install-mcp --client claude-code --apply
"$BIN" install-hooks --agent claude-code --apply
```

Memory stays in `~/Library/Application Support/ai-memory`. Replacing the
`.app` does not rewrite it. Full paths (tarball, source, Docker, launchd):
[`macos.md`](macos.md).

## From the terminal (CLI)

Most people never need these — the agent does it — but they exist:

```bash
ai-memory status                     # counts, paths, health
ai-memory doctor                     # is every harness that ran here captured?
ai-memory backfill                   # import prior local history into an empty store
ai-memory write-page …               # save a durable page
ai-memory handoffs                   # list open handoffs for the project
ai-memory message list               # cross-project inbox
ai-memory export-okf …               # export the wiki as an OKF bundle
ai-memory serve                      # run the server
```

## When it isn't doing what you expect

- **Nothing is being remembered**: hooks may not be installed. Easiest fix —
  start the harness with `ai-memory run <harness>`, which auto-installs its
  hooks + MCP on first launch; or wire it by hand with `ai-memory install-hooks
  --agent <your-agent> --apply`. Then check `ai-memory status` / `ai-memory doctor`.
- **Only *some* agents are being remembered**: run `ai-memory doctor`. It lists
  every harness that has local sessions in this project and whether the server
  captured them — so a harness you rotated in without installing its hook (a
  silent gap: it keeps its own local history while capturing nothing) shows up
  as a warning with the exact `install-hooks` command to fix it.
- **I just installed hooks in a project I've worked in for a while**: the first
  time you open the project after installing, ai-memory imports your existing
  local session history once (bounded, sanitized on the server, only into an
  empty store) so it isn't starting from nothing. It runs automatically in the
  background; you can trigger or preview it yourself with `ai-memory backfill`
  (`--dry-run` to see what it would import), or turn it off with
  `AI_MEMORY_BACKFILL_ON_START=false`.
- **A search misses something you saved**: confirm the scope — memory is
  per-project; a page saved in project A is not returned in project B unless it
  was written to the global scope or you query with an explicit scope.
- **You want an LLM feature (consolidation, digests)**: set a provider
  (`AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=…`); without one, capture + search still work.
