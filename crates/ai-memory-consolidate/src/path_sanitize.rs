//! Shared model-path sanitization for LLM-produced wiki paths.
//!
//! Both bootstrap (#847) and per-session consolidation (#848) accept a
//! page path straight from LLM structured output and hand it to
//! `Wiki::apply_batch`, which is atomic: a single path that fails
//! `PagePath::ensure_portable` at write time aborts every page in that
//! batch, not just its own. `PagePath::new` is deliberately tolerant (see
//! its doc comment) and does not catch this, so callers must sanitize the
//! raw model path themselves before constructing a `PagePath`.

/// Filename characters Windows refuses, mirroring
/// `ai_memory_core::ids`'s reserved-char set, plus `\` — `PagePath::new`
/// already rejects a literal backslash anywhere in the raw path (it reads as
/// a separator), so a component containing one must be cleaned before
/// `PagePath::new` ever sees it, not after.
pub(crate) const PATH_ILLEGAL_CHARS: &[char] = &['<', '>', ':', '"', '|', '?', '*', '\\'];

/// Clean a model-produced page path so it survives `PagePath::new` and
/// `ensure_portable`.
///
/// The LLM sometimes echoes free text — a conventional-commit subject like
/// `build(sandbox): orchestrate` — straight into a page path. That passes
/// `PagePath::new` (deliberately tolerant; see its doc comment) but fails
/// `ensure_portable`, which `Wiki::apply_batch` enforces atomically: one bad
/// path there aborts every page in the batch, not just its own (#847, #848).
/// Replace every Windows-illegal character and ASCII control byte in each
/// `/`-separated component with `-`, keeping the `dir/subdir/name.md` shape
/// intact so the model's intended layout survives.
